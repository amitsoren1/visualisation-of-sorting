# Sorting-visuals
A C++ application to implement a visual representation of sorting algorithms 
Description: Used a graphics library (like graphics.h) to show the real-time sorting of randomly generated numbers. Generated random numbers of sample space (say 100 numbers) and performed sorting using different sorting algorithms. (namely quicksort, mergesort, insertionsort, selection sort)
You can also change the delay value inside the code for faster/slower visualization. Proper comments have been given for user's ease.
